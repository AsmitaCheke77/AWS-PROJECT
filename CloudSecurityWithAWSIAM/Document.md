## Introduction
- ### What is AWS IAM?
  AWS IAM manages access to AWS resources by controlling users, groups, roles, and permissions, enhancing security and ensuring appropriate access.

- ### How I'm using AWS IAM in this project
  In today's project, I used AWS IAM to manage user access by creating roles and policies to control permissions, ensuring that only authorized users could access and modify the 
  necessary AWS resources.

- ### One thing I didn't expect...
  One unexpected aspect of the project was the complexity of fine-tuning IAM policies to meet precise security needs. It required detailed adjustments to permissions to balance access 
  and security effectively.

- ### This project took me...
  The project took me about an hour to complete, including time for planning, implementation, testing, adjustments and documentation.

## Tags
- Tags in AWS are labels attached to resources for organization, enabling easy identification, filtering, and management. They aid in cost allocation, applying policies, and 
  distinguishing resources by environment type.

- In Production Tag : Key: Env, Value: production. In Development Tag : Key :Env, Value : development

## IAM Policies
An IAM policy grants or restricts permissions for IAM users, groups, or roles to perform actions on AWS resources under specified conditions.

- ### The policy I set up
  For this project, Iâ€™ve set up a policy using JSON.

  The effect of an IAM policy specifies whether access is "Allow" or "Deny" for actions on AWS resources.

- ### When creating a JSON policy, you have to define its Effect, Action and Resource.

  In a JSON policy, Effect specifies whether the action is allowed or denied, Action defines the operations that can be performed, and Resource identifies the AWS resources the actions 
  apply to. Together, they control access and permissions.

## My JSON Policy

## Account Alias

An Account Alias in AWS is a user-friendly name that you can assign to your AWS account instead of using the default account ID. It simplifies login URLs and makes account identification easier, especially when managing multiple accounts.

Creating an account alias took me about 2 minutes.

Now, my new AWS console sign-in URL is "sumitmawal.signin.aws.amazon.com/console".

## IAM Users and User Groups

- ### Users
  IAM users in AWS are unique identities with their own credentials for accessing AWS resources. They are assigned permissions through policies to control what actions they can perform 
  and on which resources.

- ### User Groups
  IAM user groups in AWS are collections of IAM users that simplify permission management by applying policies to the entire group rather than individual users.

  Attaching a policy to an IAM user group grants the permissions defined in the policy to all members of the group. This ensures that every user in the group inherits the same access 
  rights and restrictions.

## Logging in as an IAM User
-  You can share a new user's sign-in details by sending them the autogenerated credentials via email or providing a temporary sign-in link.

-  I noticed that some of my dashboard panels are showing access denied already.

## Testing IAM Policies
I tested my JSON IAM policy by applying it to a test user or group and verifying the permissions by attempting to access the AWS resources or perform actions specified in the policy.

- ### Stopping the production instance
  It showed the red banner of failed to stop the production instance.

- ### Stopping the development instance
  Next, when I tried to stop the development instance it showed me the success banner.

## IAM Policy Simulator
- ### The IAM Policy Simulator is a tool provided by AWS that allows you to test and troubleshoot IAM policies to see how they would affect access to resources without actually applying them.
- ### It helps in validating policies by simulating the effects of different policies on users, groups, or roles, enabling you to ensure that the permissions are set up correctly before implementation.
